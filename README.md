## Database

![Database schema](./doc/db.png)

The `beers` table contains all static information about a beer type. On the other hand, `history` contains dynamic information such as the current price and quantity. For instance, a beer current selling price can simply be found by looking at its most recent history entry.

The `users` and `tokens` tables are used to authenticate accesses to the API.
